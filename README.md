**qrafter is a small type-safe SQL query builder for Go - no ORM, no codegen, just typed SQL-shaped Go.**

qrafter helps you build parameterized SQL from typed Go table structs.
You define tables once, compose queries from typed columns, and render SQL plus
driver arguments for `database/sql`, `sqlx`, and similar packages.

It is designed for Go developers who want to keep SQL explicit, but avoid
hand-writing fragile column names, placeholders, and query fragments.

## Why qrafter?

Use qrafter when you want:

- Typed table and column references with `qrafter.Column[T]`
- SQL that still looks and feels like SQL
- Parameterized queries instead of interpolated user values
- Dialect-aware identifier quoting and placeholders
- Compatibility with your existing database driver and connection pool
- A lightweight query builder instead of a full ORM
- No code generation step in your build workflow

qrafter is probably not the right fit if you want schema migrations, model
lifecycle hooks, relationship loading, or an ORM that hides SQL from application
code.

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/SennovE/qrafter
````

## Quick start

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	q "github.com/SennovE/qrafter"
	"github.com/SennovE/qrafter/dialect"
)

type User struct {
	q.Table `table:"users"`

	ID       q.Column[int] `db:"id"`
	UserName q.Column[string]
	Age      q.Column[int]
}

func main() {
	users := q.MustNewTable[User]()

	sql, args := q.Select(users.ID, users.UserName).
		Where(
			users.Age.Ge(18),
			users.UserName.Eq("Alice"),
		).
		OrderBy(users.ID.Asc()).
		Limit(10).
		Render(dialect.PostgreSQL{})

	fmt.Println(sql)
	fmt.Println(args)
}
```

Output:

```text
SELECT "users"."id", "users"."user_name"
FROM "users"
WHERE "users"."age" >= $1 AND "users"."user_name" = $2
ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC
LIMIT 10
[18 Alice]
```

## How it works

A qrafter table is a Go struct with typed column fields:

```go
type User struct {
	q.Table `table:"users"`

	ID       q.Column[int] `db:"id"`
	UserName q.Column[string]
	Age      q.Column[int]
}
```

`q.MustNewTable[User]()` binds the struct fields to SQL table and column names.
Queries are then composed from those typed columns and rendered for a selected
SQL dialect.

Field names are converted into column names automatically, or you can override
them with `db` tags.

## When to use it

qrafter is useful when you want typed query composition while still keeping
control over the generated SQL.

Good fits:

* services that already use `database/sql` or `sqlx`
* projects that prefer explicit SQL over ORM abstractions
* codebases where query fragments need to be composed safely
* applications that want typed table and column references without codegen

Less ideal fits:

* projects that want a full ORM
* applications that expect automatic relationship loading
* teams that prefer writing raw SQL files and generating Go code from them
* projects that need schema migrations as part of the same tool

## Features

* Typed table structs with `qrafter.Column[T]`
* Table configuration via embedded `qrafter.Table` or `TableConfig()`
* Automatic column binding from field names or `db` tags
* Custom field-to-column mapping through `qrafter.NameMapper`
* Dialect-aware identifier quoting and placeholders
* Human-readable multiline SQL rendering
* Parameterized `SELECT`, joins, grouping, ordering, limits, and offsets
* Parameterized `INSERT` with `VALUES`, `DEFAULT VALUES`, `INSERT ... SELECT`, and `RETURNING`
* Parameterized `UPDATE` with `SET`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, CTEs, and `RETURNING`
* Parameterized `DELETE` with `WHERE`, `USING`, CTEs, and `RETURNING`
* CTEs and recursive CTEs
* Compound queries such as `UNION` and `UNION ALL`
* Aggregates and window functions
* `database/sql` and `sqlx`-friendly scanning helpers

## Dialects

qrafter currently includes:

* `dialect.BaseDialect` for ANSI-style double-quoted identifiers and `?` placeholders
* `dialect.PostgreSQL` for PostgreSQL-style `$1`, `$2`, ... placeholders
* `dialect.MySQL` for backtick-quoted identifiers and MySQL `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`
* `dialect.SQLite` for SQLite literals and `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`

Dialect support currently covers syntax qrafter can vary safely: identifier
quoting, literals, placeholders, and `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`. Some features still need
dedicated per-database rendering before they are fully portable, such as
`RETURNING`, `UPDATE ... FROM`, `DELETE ... USING`, and `NULLS FIRST/LAST`.

New dialects can be added by implementing `dialect.Renderer`.

## Comparison

| Approach            | Good when                                             | Tradeoff                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raw `database/sql`  | You want full control over every query                | SQL strings, placeholders, and column names are maintained manually |
| SQL code generation | You want generated Go code from SQL files             | Adds a generation step and a SQL-first workflow                     |
| ORM                 | You want high-level model and relationship management | SQL can become less explicit and harder to control                  |
| qrafter             | You want typed SQL-shaped Go without ORM or codegen   | It is a lightweight query builder, not a full database framework    |

## Project status

qrafter is pre-v1. The API may still change while the package evolves.

Feedback is especially welcome around:

* API naming
* query composition ergonomics
* dialect support
* real-world usage with `database/sql` and `sqlx`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the local
development workflow and pull request guidelines.

Good first areas to explore:

* Add examples for common query patterns
* Improve dialect coverage
* Expand integration tests
* Polish package documentation on pkg.go.dev
